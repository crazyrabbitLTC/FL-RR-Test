This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### 'Notes'

I did not build a "landing page" for the app. To load simply navigate to localhost:3000/address/ or localhost:3000/block/
From that point it should be simple and self-explanatory. 


You need to create a "secrets.js" file in your src director that exports your Etherscan API key.
